# [Y]et [A]nother [C]ustom [K]ey Board

## Experimental Fork of the ZMK Project

This is an experimental fork - it is not guaranteed to be functional. The original source of the ZMK project is
[here](https://www.github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk).

The present fork was created on 2022-11-26 from the `main` branch at https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk with the mouse
functions branch `mouse-ftc` of https://github.com/ftc/zmk and the Pimoroni PIM 447 track ball branch `mouse-pim447` of
https://github.com/cdc-mkb/zmk merged in.

The shield `twobytwo3` is a proof of principle with the following features:

* split wireless keyboard with Nice!Nano controller on each half
* 2x2 keyboard matrix on each half: rows on pins 15,14; columns on pins 16,10; diodes from row to column
* right half has got a Pimoroni PM447 Track Ball with SDA on pin 2, SCL on pin 3, INT not connected (all pin numbers
  above use the Pro Micro numbering)

I have extended the Pimoroni PIM 447 track ball driver and implemented inertia, acceleration depending on the immediate
past and made these parameters configurable from the device tree. The shield ` twobytwo3` contains a sample
configuration.

The following is the original README
